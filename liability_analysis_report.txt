**Liability Analysis Report**

**Introduction**

This report provides a liability analysis based on the provided summaries of documents related to Sofia Bayawa's personal injury claim against various parties involved in an accident on March 22, 2024. The claimant alleges that she was injured while shopping at a Safeway store when a rotisserie chicken fell onto her leg due to a defective design of the cardboard handle.

**Parties Involved**

1. Sofia Bayawa (claimant)
2. Albertsons Safeway LLC (defendant)
3. Safeway Inc. (defendant)
4. Southern Champion Tray LLC (defendant)
5. Travelers Insurance (insurer of Southern Champion Tray)

**Facts of the Incident**

* The incident occurred on March 22, 2024, at a Safeway store in San Francisco.
* Bayawa picked up a rotisserie chicken from the hot plate shelves, and the cardboard handle broke, causing the chicken to fall onto her leg.
* The claimant sustained a burn injury and scarring.
* Safeway's insurance company, Sedgwick Claims Management Services, initially denied the claim, stating that the injury was caused by a faulty packaging handle, but Safeway was not responsible.
* The claim was then forwarded to Southern Champion Tray, the company responsible for the packaging.
* Travelers Insurance, the insurer of Southern Champion Tray, also denied the claim, stating that their insured was not liable for the damages.

**Liability Assessment**

Based on the facts of the incident and the summaries of documents provided, it is likely that Southern Champion Tray LLC is liable for the damages sustained by Bayawa. The defective design of the cardboard handle appears to be the proximate cause of the injury, and the claimant has provided evidence that the product was unreasonably dangerous.

Safeway Inc. and Albertsons Safeway LLC may also be liable as retailers of the defective product. Under California law, retailers can be held liable for selling defective products, even if they did not manufacture them.

Travelers Insurance's denial of the claim appears to be unfounded, and the insurer may be liable for bad faith insurance practices.

**Recommendations**

1. Further investigation is needed to determine the extent of liability of each party.
2. Bayawa should consider filing a separate claim against Travelers Insurance for bad faith insurance practices.
3. The defendants should consider offering a settlement to Bayawa to avoid a lengthy and costly trial.
4. Bayawa's attorney should investigate potential claims against other parties, such as the store where the incident occurred.

**Conclusion**

Based on the summaries of documents provided, it appears that Southern Champion Tray LLC is liable for the damages sustained by Sofia Bayawa. Safeway Inc. and Albertsons Safeway LLC may also be liable as retailers of the defective product. Travelers Insurance's denial of the claim appears to be unfounded, and further investigation is needed to determine the extent of liability of each party.
